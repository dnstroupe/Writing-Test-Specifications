# Writing-Test-Specifications
One of the first steps for many TDD projects is determining which tests need to be written for a project, feature, or piece of code. 
These range from unit tests (at a very low level, what result we should expect from calling a specific function or piece of code), to functional tests 
(what does our website or app need to do when a user performs some action).

In this workshop, you are going to write instructions for tests, often known as test specifications, or test specs, for a series of prompts.
